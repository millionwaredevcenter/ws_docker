you just left my flat 
so I left the bed naked 
put my face back on 
took a shower got dressed fed the cat
did normal things really watered the plants 
got stoned went for drinks then got some sleep
just me

hustlin'
space matter

not thinking leaving everything
I thought I've known and I thought I could've
felt under my skin 
so tough so rough so thick
my scars my injuries my demons my death
several times a day when you look at me and 
touch me deep shit happens and my breath
stops my perceptions change
my life turns out to be so weird

and I was not prepared to dive into this 
to fall again to be weak to be me
with falling star under my feet to be hanging 
from a cliff then jumping into the void not 
breathing all wild all wet and all real

suddenly 
out of nowhere
I feel free 
with you in the beginning middle end
of the day I find myself 
to be very 
me

despite
you leaving my flat and
soon also leaving me

years ago I wouldn't even have noticed all of this
I would have been sitting behind my mac tired 
frustrated simply not the best myself I could ever be
wasting my time with configuration nightmares 
not seeing clearly what I really truly inevitably need

to operate my docker infrastructure for the win
it took me years until I hit that thing 
that finally helped me speed
up my business my life and I succeeded thanks lord
I found @nohaapav and @mrq1911 who built
such a UI used such stack 
all open source
my life's never gonna be the same thanks to this
unbelievably amazing
